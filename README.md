# minishell

Minishell is a 42 School common core projet made with [victor-chevillotte](https://github.com/victor-chevillotte)


The goal is to create a program in C that can parse and handle commands (with env / pipes / redirections) with a behaviour closest possible to bash 


Constraints :
- written in C with 42 Norm
- no leak allowed
- only a limited set of functions from libc is allowed


Learned :
- bash
- forks
- pipes
- execve
- env
